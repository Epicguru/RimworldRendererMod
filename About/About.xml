  Creates a video file from all the images created by the Progress Renderer mod (or even just screenshots)!
  You want a timelapse? You got one
  
  [IMPORTANT] This only works on Windows x64! Don't try to run this on Mac/Linux, it won't work!
  
  This is a WIP mod. The interface is not very pretty, and I will update it when I get time.
  For help and more info on the mod, find it on Github and read the instructions.
