&lt;size=24&gt;You want a timelapse? You got one!&lt;/size&gt;
Creates a video file from all the images created by the Progress Renderer mod (or even just screenshots)!
 
&lt;b&gt;[IMPORTANT] This only works on Windows x64! Don't try to run this on Mac/Linux, it won't work!&lt;/b&gt;
  
This is a WIP mod. The interface is not very pretty, and I will update it when I get time.
For help and more info on the mod, find it on Github and read the instructions.
